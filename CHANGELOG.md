Behavior is cross-checked against [pie](https://github.com/c4pt0r/pie) source, file by file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- streamable_http MCP sources: the idle timeout was a deadline on the whole GET stream, so a busy
  stream was cut every `sse_idle_timeout_ms` (60 s), failing in-flight calls and re-handshaking.
  Like pie it now bounds only the wait for the response headers and for each chunk.
- Sub-agent processes (`pi -p` loop runs and trigger checks) consumed MCP pushes and could spawn
  nested trigger sub-agents with no ceiling. Like pie, sub-agents keep the MCP tools but ignore
  pushes, and the trigger runtime audits anything reaching hop ≥ 1 as `cycle_suppressed`.
- `/session-export --exclude-triggers` still bundled cron jobs and loop state; like pie it drops
  every automation sidecar. `/session-import` validates all sidecars before writing the session
  file and rolls back store writes on failure, so a rejected archive leaves nothing behind.
- A failing audit or dedup write inside trigger handling became an unhandled rejection. Audit
  writes are best-effort (pie's PersistenceError; `lastPersistenceError`, logged once per distinct
  error), `TriggerRuntime.handle()` never rejects, and scheduler hook failures cannot strand a run.
- Prompt-class control-plane tools (`new_trigger`, `remove_trigger`, re-enabling a trigger or a
  cron job) were auto-approved in sub-agents; like pie they are denied fail-closed there.

### Security
- `/session-import` rejects cron job and trigger rule ids that are not plain tokens: ids become
  file and directory names (`state/<id>.md`, `sessions/<id>/`), so an archive could otherwise
  reach outside the store through `/cron remove` or the import rollback.
- streamable_http MCP: `stop()` during the handshake now aborts it (the connection controller is
  held from the first POST) instead of leaving an unowned event stream.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- `promote_to_chat` results and `inject_*` MCP feeds no longer land in another project's chat:
  they are promoted only into a chat in the rule's `cwd`, otherwise routed to the inbox (`redirected` in audit).
- Project-level MCP servers' notifications were dropped in processes that did not own the timer.
  Every process now consumes what it receives; a machine-wide dedup window (`dedup.json`) keeps it to once per push.
- Loops and trigger checks ran with the timer owner's model; jobs and rules now record the creating
  session's model/thinking and run with those.
- A run that died with its process was skipped until the next slot; it is retried on the next tick.
- Stdio MCP reconnects no longer notify on every attempt; each distinct error once, 20 attempts by default.
- Queued lifecycle hooks are drained (≤3 s) on shutdown instead of being lost.

### Changed
- Plain (inject) jobs no longer catch up missed ticks by default (pie never backfills); `--catchup` opts in. Loops still do.
- Sub-agents keep the cron/trigger tools while `PI_LOOPS_HOP < 2` (pie-style hop-bounded cycle suppression) instead of never having them.
- `/cron` marks plain jobs whose session is not open as `[dormant …]`; loops whose `cwd` vanished are auto-disabled and marked `[orphan]`.
- pie's `/cron status` means list; the scheduler view is `/cron scheduler`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

First release. Everything pie ships in its automation layer, as a pure pi extension.

### Added
- `/cron add [--stateful] [--verify] "<schedule>" <prompt>` with pie's list/enable/disable/remove
  surface, schedule aliases (`hourly`, `daily`, `每小时`, …), `every 30m`, `in 10m`, `at <ISO>`.
- Stateful loops: fresh `pi -p` sub-agent per run, ≤2000-char notes carried between runs
  (`<loop-state>`), findings routed to the inbox (`<inbox>`), transcripts kept (`/cron trace`).
- Maker/checker (`--verify`, pie's phase 3): an adversarial second sub-agent keeps or drops each
  finding before it enters the inbox; fail-open on checker failure.
- `/inbox` triage with pie's exact list formats and `new → claimed/dismissed` lifecycle;
  `/inbox claim` starts a real agent turn.
- Dynamic triggers: `/new-trigger`, `/triggers status|rules|sources|enable|disable|remove|running|audit|abort`,
  `new_trigger` / `list_triggers` / `remove_trigger` / `set_trigger_state` tools, periodic sub-agent
  evaluation, fire-once, `promote_to_chat`, `[Trigger <trace>]` prefix, 5-minute dedup window.
- MCP: notification sources (stdio + streamable HTTP) with pie's `mcp.toml` schema, dedup keys,
  redacted summaries, `inject_summary` / `inject_and_run`; server tools registered with the agent.
- Lifecycle hooks (`hooks.toml`): pie's events, payload, `PI_*` and `PIE_*` env, command + webhook,
  sequential execution, process-tree kill on timeout, project hooks gated.
- Session archives: `/session-export` / `/session-import` (`.pisession`, pie's `.piesession`
  layout plus `loops/<id>.md` state files).
- pie-style side panel above the editor (`/cron panel on|off`), `Inbox: N new · running: …`
  status badge, run cards in the transcript.
- Machine-global job store with leader election across pi processes, one-shot catch-up of missed
  ticks (`--no-catchup` to opt out), per-job transcripts, run log, redaction everywhere.

### Differences from pie (deliberate)
- Jobs and rules are machine-global with a `cwd`, not session-scoped; `/cron` and `/triggers rules`
  list the current project by default.
- Missed ticks are caught up once by default; pie never backfills.
- Prompts may be up to 8 KB (pie: 4 KB).
- MCP notifications are consumed by the single process that owns the timer; every process still
  connects for tools.
